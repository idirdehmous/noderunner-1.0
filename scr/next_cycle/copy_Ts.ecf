This task saves the first guess (usually the +3h forecast) to a temporary directory for the next cycle.

If this job fails, first re-run once (it may be due to file system latency on the HPC). If it still fails:
  - has the forecast run correctly?
  - is the $SCRATCH directory full?

If an IO server is used, this task first has to gather all the partial output files.

If the model uses SURFEX (arome), the surface temperature field is replaced by that of the CANARO analysis.
